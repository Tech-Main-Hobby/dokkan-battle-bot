# Open Source Dokkan Battle BOT

Im releasing the code to give everyone an opportunity to complease dokkan events easily. 
If you want to add some features, feel free to send a pull request.

The bot is old. What does this mean? That the files here are simply the base files

# Installation

The first thing you need to do is download python from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/ (You have to install the Windows x86-64 executable installer)

After installing python 3.7.0 download the zip file of the code and run setup.exe and wait for it to finish downloading.
When the setup.exe finishes downloading, start the other .exe file
